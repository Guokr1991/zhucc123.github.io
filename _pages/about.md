# Physics of Ultrasound

by ZHUCC

# INTRODUCTION

Ultrasound application allows for noninvasive visualization of tissue structures. Real-time ultrasound images are integrated images resulting from reflection of organ surfaces and scattering within heterogeneous tissues. Ultrasound scanning is an interactive procedure involving the operator, patient, and ultrasound instruments. Although the physics behind ultrasound generation, propagation, detection, and transformation into practical information is rather complex, its clinical application is much simpler. Because ultrasound imaging has improved tremendously over the last decade, it can provide anesthesiologists opportunity to directly visualize target nerve and relevant anatomical structures. An ultrasound-guided nerve block is a critical growth area for new applications of ultrasound technology and has become an essential part of regional anesthesia. Understanding the basic ultrasound physics presented in this section will be helpful for anesthesiologists to appropriately select the transducer, set the ultrasound system, and then obtain satisfactory imaging.

# HISTORY OF ULTRASOUND

In 1880, French physicists Pierre Curie and his elder brother, Paul-Jacques Curie, discovered the piezoelectric effect in certain crystals. Paul Langevin, a student of Pierre Curie, developed piezoelectric materials, which can generate and receive mechanical vibrations with high frequency (therefore ultrasound). During World War I, ultrasound was introduced in the navy as a means to detect enemy submarines. In the medical field, however, ultrasound was initially used for therapeutic rather than diagnostic purposes. In the late 1920s, Paul Langevin discovered that high-power ultrasound could generate heat in bone and disrupt animal tissues. As a result, throughout the early 1950s ultrasound was used to treat patients with Ménière disease, Parkinson disease, and rheumatic arthritis. Diagnostic applications of ultrasound began through the collaboration of physicians and sonar (sound navigation ranging) engineers. In 1942, Karl Dussik, a neuropsychiatrist, and his brother, Friederich Dussik, a physicist, described ultrasound as a medical diagnostic tool to visualize neoplastic tissues in the brain and the cerebral ventricles. However, limitations of ultrasound instrumentation at the time prevented further development of clinical applications until the mid-1960s. The real-time B-scanner was developed in 1965 and was first introduced in obstetrics. In 1976, the first ultrasound machines coupled with Doppler measurements were commercially available. With regard to regional anesthesia, as early as 1978, La Grange and his colleagues were the first anesthesiologists to publish a case series report of ultrasound application for peripheral nerve block. They simply used a Doppler transducer to locate the subclavian artery and performed supraclavicular brachial plexus block in 61 patients (Figures 1A and 1B). Reportedly, Doppler guidance led to a high block success rate (98%) and absence of complications such as pneumothorax, phrenic nerve palsy, hematoma, convulsion, recurrent laryngeal nerve block, and spinal anesthesia. In 1989, Ting and Sivagnanaratnam reported the use of B-mode ultrasonography to demonstrate the anatomy of the axilla and to observe the spread of local anesthetics during axillary brachial plexus block.

In 1994, Stephan Kapral and colleagues systematically explored brachial plexus with B-mode ultrasound. Since that time, multiple teams worldwide have worked tirelessly to define and improve the application of ultrasound imaging in regional anesthesia. Ultrasound-guided nerve block is currently used routinely in the practice of regional anesthesia in many centers worldwide.

## Definition of Ultrasound

Sound travels as a mechanical longitudinal wave in which back-and-forth particle motion is parallel to the direction of wave travel. Ultrasound is high-frequency sound and refers to mechanical vibrations above 20 kHz. Human ears can hear sounds with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. Elephants can generate and detect sound with frequencies less than 20 Hz for long-distance communication; bats and dolphins produce sounds in the range of 20 to 100 kHz for precise navigation (Figures 2A and 2B). Ultrasound frequencies commonly used for medical diagnosis are between 2 and 15 MHz. However, sounds with frequencies above 100 kHz do not occur naturally; only human-developed devices can both generate and detect these frequencies, or ultrasounds.

## Piezoelectric Effect

Ultrasound waves can be generated by material with a piezoelectric effect. The piezoelectric effect is a phenomenon exhibited by the generation of an electric charge in response to a mechanical force (squeeze or stretch) applied on certain materials. Conversely, mechanical deformation can be produced when an electric field is applied to such material, also known as the piezoelectric effect (Figures 3). Both natural and human-made materials, including quartz crystals and ceramic materials, can demonstrate piezoelectric properties. Recently, lead zirconate titanate has been used as piezoelectric material for medical imaging. Lead-free piezoelectric materials are also under development. Individual piezoelectric materials produce a small amount of energy. However, by stacking piezoelectric elements into layers in a transducer, the transducer can convert electric energy into mechanical oscillations more efficiently. These mechanical oscillations are then converted into electric energy.

## Ultrasound Terminology

Period is the time for a sound wave to complete one cycle; the period unit of measure is the microsecond (µs). Wavelength is the length of space over which one cycle occurs; it is equal to the travel distance from the beginning to the end of one cycle. Frequency is the number of cycles repeated per second and measured in hertz (Hz). Acoustic velocity is the speed at which a sound wave travels through a medium. It is equal to the frequency times the wavelength. Speed c is determined by the density ρ and stiffness κ of the medium 

$$
(c = \sqrt{κ/ρ})
$$

. Density is the concentration of a medium. Stiffness is the resistance of a material to compression. Propagation speed increases if the stiffness is increased or the density is decreased.

The average propagation speed in soft tissues is 1540 m/s (ranges from 1400 to 1640 m/s). However, ultrasound cannot penetrate lung or bone tissues. Acoustic impedance z is the degree of difficulty demonstrated by a sound wave being transmitted through a medium; it is equal to density ρ multiplied by acoustic velocity c (z = ρc). It increases if the propagation speed or the density of the medium is increased. Attenuation coefficient is the parameter used to estimate the decrement of ultrasound amplitude in certain media as a function of ultrasound frequency. The attenuation coefficient increases with increasing frequency; therefore, a practical consequence of attenuation is that the penetration decreases as frequency increases (Figures 4).

Ultrasound waves have a self-focusing effect, which refers to the natural narrowing of the ultrasound beam at a certain travel distance in the ultrasonic field. It is a transition level between near field and far field. The beam width at the transition level is equal to half the diameter of the transducer. At the distance of two times the near-field length, the beam width reaches the transducer diameter. The self-focusing effect amplifies ultrasound signals by increasing acoustic pressure.

![Figures 4](https://www.nysora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/28x04-1.jpg)

In ultrasound imaging, there are two aspects of spatial resolution: axial and lateral. Axial resolution is the minimum separation of above-below planes along the beam axis. It is determined by spatial pulse length, which is equal to the product of wavelength and the number of cycles within a pulse. It can be presented in the following formula:

                          Axial resolution = Wavelength λ × Number of cycles per pulse n ÷ 2

The number of cycles within a pulse is determined by the damping characteristics of the transducer. The number of cycles within a pulse is usually set between 2 and 4 by the manufacturer of the ultrasound machines. As an example, if a 2-MHz ultrasound transducer is theoretically used to do the scanning, the axial resolution would be between 0.8 and 1.6 mm, making it impossible to visualize a 21-gauge needle. For constant acoustic velocity, higher-frequency ultrasound can detect smaller objects and provide an image with better resolution. The axial resolution of current ultrasound systems is between 0.05 and 0.5 mm. (Figures 5) shows images at different resolutions when a 0.5-mm diameter object is visualized with three different frequency settings.

![Figures 5](https://www.nysora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/28x05-1.jpg)
Figure 5. Ultrasound frequency affects the resolution of the imaged object. Resolution can be improved by increasing frequency and reducing the beam width by focusing. (Reproduced with permission from Hadzic A: Hadzic’s Peripheral Nerve Blocks and Anatomy for Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia, 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc; 2011.)

Lateral resolution is another parameter of sharpness to describe the minimum side-by-side distance between two objects. It is determined by both ultrasound frequency and beam width. The higher frequencies have a narrower focus and provide better axial and lateral resolution. Lateral resolution can also be improved by adjusting focus to reduce the beam width.

Temporal resolution is also important for observing a moving object such as blood vessels and heart. Like a movie or cartoon video, the human eye requires that the image is updated at a rate of approximately 25 times a second or higher for an ultrasound image to appear continuous. However, imaging resolution will be compromised by increasing the frame rate. Optimizing the ratio of resolution to the frame rate is essential for providing the best possible image.

# INTERACTIONS OF ULTRASOUND WITH TISSUES
As the ultrasound wave travels through tissues, it is subject to a number of interactions. The most important features are as follows:

- Reflection
- Scatter
- Absorption
  
When ultrasound encounters boundaries between different media, part of the ultrasound is reflected and the other part is transmitted. The reflected and transmitted directions are given by the reflection angle θr and transmission angle θt, respectively (Figure 6).

![Figures 6](https://www.nysora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/28x06-1.jpg)
Figure 6. The interaction of ultrasound waves through the media in which they travel is complex. When ultrasound encounters boundaries between different media, part of the ultrasound is reflected and part is transmitted. The reflected and transmitted directions depend on the respective angles of reflection and transmission. (Adapted with permission from Hadzic A: Hadzic’s Peripheral Nerve Blocks and Anatomy for Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia, 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc; 2011.)

Refection of sound waves is similar to optical reflection. Some of its energy is sent back into the medium from which it came. In a true reflection, the reflection angle θr must equal the incidence angle θi. The strength of the reflection from an interface is variable and depends on the difference of impedances between two affinitive media and the incident angle at the boundary. If the media impedances are equal, there is no reflection (no echo). If there is a significant difference between media impedances, there will be nearly complete reflection. For example, an interface between soft tissues and either lung or bone involves a considerable change in acoustic impedance and creates strong echoes. This reflection intensity is also highly angle dependent. In practical terms, it means that the ultrasound transducer must be placed perpendicular to the target nerve to visualize it clearly. A change in sound direction when crossing the boundary between two media is called refraction. If the propagation speed through the second medium is slower than that through the first medium, the refraction angle is smaller than the incident angle. Refraction can cause the artifact that occurs beneath large vessels on the image.

During ultrasound scanning, a coupling medium must be used between the transducer and the skin to displace air from the transducer-skin interface. A variety of gels and oils are applied for this purpose. Moreover, they can act as lubricants, making a smooth scanning performance possible. Most scanned interfaces are somewhat irregular and curved. If the boundary dimensions are significantly less than the wavelength or not smooth, the reflected waves will be diffused.

Scattering is the redirection of sound in any directions by rough surfaces or by heterogeneous media (Figure 7).

![Figures 7](https://www.nysora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/28x07-1.jpg)

Figure 7. Scattering is the redirection of ultrasound in any direction caused by rough surfaces or by heterogeneous media. (Adapted with permission from Hadzic A: Hadzic’s Peripheral Nerve Blocks and Anatomy for Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia, 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc; 2011.)

Normally, scattering intensity is much less than mirror-like reflection intensities and is relatively independent of the direction of the incident sound wave; therefore, the visualization of the target nerve is not significantly influenced by another nearby scattering.

Absorption is defined as the direct conversion of the sound energy into heat. In other words, ultrasound scanning generates heat in the tissue. Higher frequencies are absorbed in a greater rate than lower frequencies. However, a higher scanning frequency gives a better axial resolution. If the ultrasound penetration is not sufficient to visualize the structures of interest, a lower frequency is selected to increase the penetration. The use of longer wavelengths (lower frequency) results in lower resolution because the resolution of ultrasound imaging is proportional to the wavelength of the imaging wave. Frequencies between 6 and 12 MHz typically yield adequate resolution for imaging in peripheral nerve block, whereas frequencies between 2 and 5 MHz are usually needed for imaging of neuraxial structures. Frequencies of less than 2 MHz or higher than 15 MHz are rarely used because of insufficient resolution or the insufficient penetration depth in most clinical applications.

# ULTRASOUND IMAGE MODES
## A-Mode
The A-mode is the oldest ultrasound technique and was invented in 1930. The transducer sends a single pulse of ultrasound into the medium. Consequently, a one-dimensional simplest ultrasound image is created on which a series of vertical peaks is generated after ultrasound beams encounter the boundary of the different tissue. The distance between the echoed spikes (Figure 8) can be calculated by dividing the speed of ultrasound in the tissue (1540 m/s) by half the elapsed time, but it provides little information on the spatial relationship of imaged structures. Therefore, A-mode ultrasound is not applicable to regional anesthesia.

![Figures 8](https://www.nysora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/28x08-1.jpg)
Figure 8. The A-mode of ultrasound consists of a one-dimensional ultrasound image displayed as a series of vertical peaks corresponding to the depth of structures the ultrasound encounters in different tissues.

## B-Mode
The B-mode is a two-dimensional (2D) image of the area that is simultaneously scanned by a linear array of 100–300 piezoelectric elements rather than a single one as in A-mode (Figure 9). The amplitude of the echo from a series of A-scans is converted into dots of different brightness in B-mode imaging. The horizontal and vertical directions represent real distances in tissue, whereas the intensity of the grayscale indicates echo strength (Figure 10). B-mode can provide an image of a cross section through the area of interest, and it is the primary mode currently used in regional anesthesia.

## Doppler Mode
The Doppler effect is based on the work of Austrian physicist Johann Christian Doppler. The term describes a change in the frequency or wavelength of a sound wave resulting from relative motion between the sound source and the sound receiver. In other words, at a stationary position, the sound frequency is constant. If the sound source moves toward the sound receiver, the sound waves have to be squeezed, and a higher-pitch sound occurs (positive Doppler shift); if the sound source moves away from the receiver, the sound waves have to be stretched, and the received sound has a lower pitch (negative Doppler shift) (Figure 11). The magnitude of Doppler shift depends on the incident angle between the directions of emitted ultrasound beam and moving reflectors. With a 90° angle there is no Doppler shift. If the angle is 0° or 180°, the largest Doppler shift can be detected. In medical settings, the Doppler shifts usually fall in the audible range.

Color Doppler produces a color-coded map of Doppler shifts superimposed onto a B-mode ultrasound image. Blood flow direction depends on whether the motion is toward or away from the transducer. Selected by convention, red and blue colors provide information about the direction and velocity of the blood flow. According to the color map (color bar) in the upper left-hand corner of the figure (Figure 12), the red color on the top of the bar denotes the flow coming toward the ultrasound probe, and the blue color on the bottom of the bar indicates the flow away from the probe.

Selected by convention, red and blue colors provide information about the direction and velocity of the blood flow.

![Figures 13](https://www.nysora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/28x13-1.jpg)
Figure 13. Color Doppler mode is used to detect the direction of the blood vessel.

In ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blocks, color Doppler mode is used to detect the presence and nature of the blood vessels (artery vs. vein) in the area of interest. When the direction of the ultrasound beam changes, the color of the arterial flow switches from blue to red, or vice versa, depending on the convention used (Figures 13, 14A, 14B, and 14C). Power Doppler is up to five times more sensitive in detecting blood flow than color Doppler, and it is less dependent on the scanning angle. Thus, power Doppler can be used to identify the smaller blood vessels more reliably. The drawback is that power Doppler does not provide any information on the direction and speed of blood flow (Figure 15).

B: Carotid artery displays ambiguous color at a 90° Doppler angle; the equal waveform can be seen on both sides of the baseline. C: Carotid artery displays blue color when the blood flows away from the transducer.
